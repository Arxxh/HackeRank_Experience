# Tree: Inorder Traversal

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Topics:** N/A  
**HackerRank URL:** [Tree: Inorder Traversal](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/tree-inorder-traversal/problem)

## Problem Description

In this challenge, you are required to implement inorder traversal of a tree.

Complete the  function in your editor below, which has  parameter: a pointer to the root of a binary tree. It must print the values in the tree's inorder traversal as a single line of space-separated values.

**Input Format**

Our hidden tester code passes the root node of a binary tree to your $inOrder* function.

**Constraints**

**Output Format**

Print the tree's inorder traversal as a single line of space-separated values.

**Sample Input**

```
     1
      \
       2
        \
         5
        /  \
       3    6
        \
         4

```

**Sample Output**

```
1 2 3 4 5 6

```

**Explanation**

The tree's inorder traversal results in       as the required result.

## Solution

```cpp
// HackerRank Problem: Tree: Inorder Traversal
// Link: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/tree-inorder-traversal/problem
// Difficulty: Easy
// Language: cpp



/* you only have to complete the function given below.  
Node is defined as  

class Node {
    public:
        int data;
        Node *left;
        Node *right;
        Node(int d) {
            data = d;
            left = NULL;
            right = NULL;
        }
};

*/

   void inOrder(Node *root) {
         if(root) {
            inOrder(root->left);
            cout << root->data << " ";
            inOrder(root->right);
        }
    }
