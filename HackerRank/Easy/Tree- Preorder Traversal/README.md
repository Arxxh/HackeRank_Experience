# Tree: Preorder Traversal

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Topics:** N/A  
**HackerRank URL:** [Tree: Preorder Traversal](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/tree-preorder-traversal/problem)

## Problem Description

Complete the  function in the editor below, which has  parameter: a pointer to the root of a binary tree. It must print the values in the tree's preorder traversal as a single line of space-separated values.

**Input Format**

Our test code passes the root node of a binary tree to the *preOrder* function.

**Constraints**

 Nodes in the tree

**Output Format**

Print the tree's preorder traversal as a single line of space-separated values.

**Sample Input**

```
     1
      \
       2
        \
         5
        /  \
       3    6
        \
         4

```

**Sample Output**

```
1 2 5 3 4 6

```

**Explanation**

The preorder traversal of the binary tree is printed.

## Solution

```cpp
// HackerRank Problem: Tree: Preorder Traversal
// Link: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/tree-preorder-traversal/problem
// Difficulty: Easy
// Language: cpp



/* you only have to complete the function given below.  
Node is defined as  

class Node {
    public:
        int data;
        Node *left;
        Node *right;
        Node(int d) {
            data = d;
            left = NULL;
            right = NULL;
        }
};

*/

    void preOrder(Node* root) {
        if(root) {
            cout << root->data << " ";
            preOrder(root->left);
            preOrder(root->right);
        }
    }

```
